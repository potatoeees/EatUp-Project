    <h1>EatUp</h1>
    <p>Greetings! EatUp, as the name implies, encourages the community to finish their food and groceries as part of a collaborative effort to reduce food waste.
    <br>
    We aim to promote sustainable consumption by tracking consumers' grocery expiration dates and by partnering with NGOs for food donations.
