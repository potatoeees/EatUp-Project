      <p>What are the UN SDGs?</p>
      <p>The UN SDG (short for Sustainable Development Goals) is a global partnership of developed and developing countries to achieve the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. Our collective effort to achieve those 17 goals can ensure the peace and prosperity of the human race and the planet.</p>
      <br>
      <p>EatUp is essentially an integrated solution to two goals, which include:
        <br>
        Goal 2: Zero Hunger and 
        <br>
        Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <img src="Album/SDG Goal 2.png" alt="Goal 2">
      <p>Goal 2: Zero Hunger targets food shortage issues and the undermining of food security happening worldwide. The goal is to improve the nutritional value of agricultural products and promote sustainable agriculture.</p>
      <br>
      <p>EatUp aims to raise more awareness on this issue by working hand in hand with NGOs to provide food donations to the needy.</p>

      <img src="Album/SDG Goal 12.png" alt="Goal 12">
      <p>  Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production patterns are the solution to the root causes of the triple planetary crisis: climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss. According to the statistics from the United Nations, more than 10% of food is wasted on both the consumer and producer sides.</p>
      <br>
      <p>EatUp intends to reduce food waste by tracking the expiration of groceries and preventing consumers from throwing food out.</p>
