# EatUp-Project

There are 3 branches on this repository for our EatUp project. 

1. test_run branch can be ignored as it contains unrelated code when we were learning how to use GitHub. 

2. master branch is where our main application lies. The code is run by Android Studio, which is our main platfrom in developing our app.

3. ecommerce branch contains the backend logic to run the essential functions of the app. The logic is deployed as a web service in which the app interacts with by posting requests and returns response objects in JSON formats.
