       \nGoal 2: Zero Hunger and \nGoal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production.</string>

    <string name="goal_2_zero">Goal 2: Zero Hunger targets food shortage issues and the undermining of food security happening worldwide.The goal is to improve the nutritional value of agricultural products and promote sustainable agriculture.\n</string>
    <string name="goal_2_zero_2">EatUp aims to raise more awareness on this issue by working hand in hand with NGOs to provide food donations to the needy.</string>

    <string name="goal_12_res">

Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production patterns are the solution to the root causes of the triple planetary crisis: climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss.
